## Architecture

Our template brings an architecture based on four models:

- Category
- Tags
- Profile
- Post

The following is the entity relationship schema:
![Template's Entity Relationship graphic.](./StrapiTemplateERGraph.png)

Profile is intended to be also an extension of the Strapi's user model. It is up to the developer to chose between `users-permission`, Strapi's external users, and `admin`, Strapi's admin panel users. If the developer decides by `admin`, it can manage to auto fill the `author` field based on the current session user's author.

## Plugins
For the current template we pick a set of plugins to add some features by default:
- [Navigation](https://github.com/VirtusLab-Open-Source/strapi-plugin-navigation): A plugin for Strapi Headless CMS that provides navigation / menu builder feature with their possibility to control the audience and different output structure renderers like (flat, tree and RFR - ready for handling by Redux First Router).
- [Preview Button](https://github.com/mattmilburn/strapi-plugin-preview-button): A plugin for Strapi CMS that adds a preview button and live view button to the content manager edit and list view. It has an [PR candidate](https://github.com/mattmilburn/strapi-plugin-preview-button/pull/133/files) for Strapi 5 in development.
- [SEO](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-plugin-seo): The official plugin to make your Strapi content SEO friendly.[ We asked an update](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-plugin-seo/issues/70) for Strapi 5.
- [Sitemap](https://github.com/pluginpal/strapi-plugin-sitemap): Generate a highly customizable sitemap XML in Strapi CMS.
  
We also recommend to check the following plugins when it is required:
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://github.com/sarhugo/strapi-plugin-cloudflare-pages): A plugin to easily trigger Cloudflare Pages builds from Strapi. Since [we can use webhooks to keep the Vercel deployed pages updated](https://strapi.io/blog/how-to-create-an-ssg-static-site-generation-application-with-strapi-webhooks-and-nextjs), we don't recomment any plugin for Vercel.
- [Meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/strapi-plugin-meilisearch): A strapi plugin to add your collections to Meilisearch, making easier to add searching features to your frontend. We were unable to find a plugin for Typesense, another powerful search engine; [we asked for it](https://github.com/typesense/typesense/issues/1691) on the repository.
All plugins listed here don't currently support Strapi 5 yet.
